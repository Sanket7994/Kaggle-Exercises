About the Premier League:
The Premier League was founded on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.
In total, 50 clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven teams overall have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).
